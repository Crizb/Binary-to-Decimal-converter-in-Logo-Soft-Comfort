# Binary-to-Decimal-converter-in-Logo-Soft-Comfort

This project was a proof to my "PLC" professor that I was worthy of the best grade at his subject

Maximal number that can be converted can consist of 20 ones or zeros, so the biggest number that one can convert is 1048575 (But it takes A LOT of time to do so).
