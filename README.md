# Binary-to-Decimal-converter-in-Logo-Soft-Comfort

This project was a proof to my "PLC" professor that I was worthy of the best grade at his subject
This was just a proof and was not made to be used in a "real life" aplication. 
Maximal number that can be converted can consist of 20 ones or zeros, so the biggest number that one can convert is 1048575 (But it takes A LOT of time to do so).

And that is how everything should look like when you open the program:
